You may use this however you'd like, but there must be visible credit to myself (biggs) or @biggs.exe (discord). 

Some of my plugins I want to share with the public, to further the community. ALL can be used however you want but you MUST give credits where used.

This was developed on my own private API. You will have to port it to the API of your choice. (Preferably microbot, as they actually care about the community)!
